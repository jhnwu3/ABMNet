# ABMNets

Training a neural network to act as a surrogate model for Agent Based Models to speed up parameter estimation in cancer and immune cell models.

For a more complex model that includes a temporal component see [here]().



## What is Surrogate Modeling?

## Why Surrogate Modeling?

Here is a flowchart providing some contextual relationships as to how a surrogate relates to an actual mechanistic model and what we are using it for.
